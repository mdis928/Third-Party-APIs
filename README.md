# Third-Party-APIs

Hello and welcome to the fifth homework. The task here was to create a simple calendar application. Most of the code was given however, we needed to add some to code to html and and create a script. 

When you open up the webpage and the code, I have to create multiple divs so that act as div blocks. The typical work week for those that hustle start early and end late at night so my calendar starts at 5:00AM and ends at 9:00PM. In JS, there are four main parts that complete the criteria for the functionality. I used moment JS so that we had the exact same time and day. The time blocks update when if it is in the past, present, or future. the time block turns gey when that time block is the past. Blue mean prent time black. and green means the remaining day. We also needed to use local storage so that your events are recorded. So when you click refresh, the calendar doesn't clear.

Feel free to give it a try!

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule...

WHEN I open the planner, THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar ✔️

WHEN I scroll down, THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours ✔️

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day,THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future ✔️

WHEN I click into a timeblock, THEN I can enter an event ✔️

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock, THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage ✔️

WHEN I refresh the page, THEN the saved events persist ✔️
